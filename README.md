3D Creator
==========

3D Creator is a prototype that enables students (grades 7-12) to use block-based programming to create immersive 3D scenes. It's designed such that students only need knowledge of x, y, and z planes, and it gently introduces more complex topics as students build more scenes.

It provides an immediate feedback loop (when a block is added, the scene automatically updates, with no render time) and uses PBR (Physically Based Rendering) to create realistic materials, reflections, and lighting.

Designed to have minimal hardware requirements, 3D Creator is browser-based and requires no installation. It also runs well (at 60fps) on most low-end laptops and Chromebooks.
